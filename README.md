# Dr Magnet Hands

This is a website implementation of the game Dr Magnethands by Grant Howitt

https://lookrobot.co.uk/doctor-magnethands/


It only supports a single play session and requires some manual backend work to init the session.

It's entirely serverless and runs on lambda functions behind an API gateway and a dynamo db. The site
itself is served from s3.
